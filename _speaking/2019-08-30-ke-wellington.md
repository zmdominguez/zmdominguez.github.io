title: "Supercharging Your Debug Builds"
excerpt: "This talk discusses how we can incorporate tools into our debug builds to help ease development challenges"
---
If we take a peek under the hood of any modern app, chances are there is so much more than meets the eye. What eventually ends up in the hands of our users is an amalgamation of feature toggles, A/B tests, one-shot screens, and the like. Having to make a new build every time we change each of these configurations take a lot of time and effort. When issues are reported, it can be a bit challenging debugging them without being connected to a laptop.

In this talk, we will discuss how we can incorporate tools into our debug builds to help ease these challenges. Among the topics we will cover are local feature flags management, surfacing stack traces, enabling visual debugging cues, grabbing Logcat traces from real devices, and helper screens to help us work more closely with designers.
