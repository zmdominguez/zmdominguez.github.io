title: "Real talk: Data binding"
---

This video is part of the Affogato drop of the [AsyncAndroid collective](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qBi3QVQ8ow-QrIBeJi9ig).

Since its initial release in 2015, the data binding library has grown to be a beloved staple in our apps. In this talk, we discuss the tried and tested ways of using the library in our real-life projects, our most favourite features to use, and some of the most recent advances in IDE support.
