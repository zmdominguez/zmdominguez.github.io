Or, how to find joy in development through small things.

Being an Android developer is hard work. Chances are, we spend our whole day in Android Studio and there are hundreds of settings, configurations, and shortcuts. Getting to know the tool can easily become overwhelming.

In this talk, we will go through tools and helpers that will help make our day-to-day development work easier, prettier, and more joyful. We will discuss useful configurations for Android Studio, plugins and tools that help with debugging, and tips on code organisation and styling.
