From someone who hated (and almost failed) programming in uni, staying in tech for 13 years is a unique milestone. Technology and best practices have changed a lot since I started, and I have changed a lot too.

From being a self-taught developer to being a Google Developer Expert, I have been through some interesting highs and lows throughout the years -- including moving to a new country!

In this talk I will share some of the lessons I have learned along the way that helped shape my current outlook as a developer and as a team member.
