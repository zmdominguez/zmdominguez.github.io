I was thinking of starting a quick-tips style blog for software development (mostly for myself, since I tend to forget stuff a lot recently).

And since I am working on Android now, this would most probably focus on tips and notes on application development for that platform.

And now, I test [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/).



```java
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  TextView text = new TextView();
  text.setText("Hello, Droid warriors!");
  setContentView(text);
}
```


And now I test external images!
