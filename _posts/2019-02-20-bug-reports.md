"This tool sucks :facepunch::rage::rage::rage::rage:"

"Ugh WTF this is so stupid :poop:"

These are just some of the things I have heard developers over the years whilst working on Android. Sometimes they are trying to figure something out and there is not enough documentation, sometimes they are trying to make their tools do something and it is not discoverable. Oftentimes, it is because they are expecting something to happen and it does not.

I know it can be frustrating, I have been a dev for more than a 12 years now after all. But then again, no matter how much or how loudly you curse the Android gods, where does that get you? Does it fix the issue? Does it improve the situation? I do not think so.

So what should we do then?

My answer has, and always will be, "have you filed a bug for it?"



What makes a good report? https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/38213600
- has a sample project that reproduces the error
- provide a screenshot
- Android Studio version
- provide as much detail as you can
- When a case was missed, repro project
- 

It might be time-consuming, but when the bug you reported gets fixed and other devs start to notice and benefit from it, it is very rewarding. :green_heart:

I might be totally wrong but I'd like to think [my bug report](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/62685775) helped nudge this along :sweat_smile:</center>

Sometimes, [my feature requests](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37136823) actually get built too!
