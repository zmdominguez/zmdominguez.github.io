Last year, I wrote about my [talk preparation process](https://zdominguez.com/2017/04/17/all-it-takes-patience.html). I mentioned that I try to practice my talk verbatim a bunch of times, especially the night prior.  

I have been trialling out a new strategy for my talks recently and I think it works really well.  

During one of my practice runs, I keep a notepad beside me and jot down a few key slides in my talk. The more evenly-spaced out they are, the better. I then set a stopwatch (I use [Timely](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely&hl=en_AU)), and start practicing.  

Once I hit those slides I have written down, I put that down as a lap and jot the time down across the slide number. I keep on going until I finish the whole talk.

<small>Keeping time (and please pardon my handwriting)</small></p>  

I try to do this at least twice -- the more data points the better! I found out that my lap times tend to diverge +/- a minute or so on each iteration. Once I am happy with the general timing, it's time to make the times official!  

I then add the times to my speaker notes, making sure I use a BIG FONT so that it's easy to read.

I find that having those time checks in there help make sure that I pace myself well during the actual talk. I tend to speak fast when I am nervous, so knowing that I am going at the right speed helps calm me down a bit.  

I cannot rely on just the number of slides remaining, as some take longer or shorter than others (I had a slide during [my talk at Mobile Refresh](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wnYWzS3z-ZZP0nDwA6p_PRi62BR9BnPO3-lNUoKVPMk/present?slide=id.p) Wellington that took me two minutes to get through üòù). Having the time written down means I can concentrate on what I have to say without worrying about timekeeping in my head!  

Bonus tip: Taking a sip of water helps calm down the nerves! Highly recommend to add "WATER BREAK! ü•õ" notes as well.
