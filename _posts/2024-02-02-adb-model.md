Last year, I wrote about [an extended `adb`](https://zarah.dev/2023/09/21/adb-devices.html) script. The idea of the script is to make it really easy to issue an `adb` command even if there are multiple devices attached by presenting a chooser. For example, if I have two physical devices and an emulator and I want to use my deeplink `alias`, I get presented with a device chooser:
```shell
‚ûú  ~ deeplink https://zarah.dev
Multiple devices found:
1 - R5CR7039LBJ
2 - 39030FDJH01460
3 - emulator-5554
Select device: 
```

I wrote about this alias and how it works [here](https://zarah.dev/2023/08/30/adb-deeplinks.html).

What I eventually learned is that I cannot remember which of those devices is my test phone (which has the app that handles the deeplink) and which is my personal phone. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It would be great if it also shows at least what _kind_ of phone it is. Well, it turns out that `adb devices` _can_ tell us this information! Hooray! The trick is to [include the `-l` option](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#devicestatus):
```shell
‚ûú  ~ adb devices -l
List of devices attached
R5CR7039LBJ            device usb:35926016X product:p3sxxx model:SM_G998B device:p3s transport_id:1
39030FDJH01460         device usb:34930688X product:shiba model:Pixel_8 device:shiba transport_id:1
emulator-5554          device product:sdk_gphone64_arm64 model:sdk_gphone64_arm64 device:emu64a transport_id:2
```

As before, let's find all valid devices, dropping any unauthorised ones, but this time let's grab all the information up to the model name: 
```shell
valid_devices=$(echo "$all_devices" | grep -v "unauthorized" | grep -oE ".*?model:\S*")
```

At this point, the variable `valid_devices` contains the following:
```shell
R5CR7039LBJ            device usb:35926016X product:p3sxxx model:SM_G998B
39030FDJH01460         device usb:34930688X product:shiba model:Pixel_8
emulator-5554          device product:sdk_gphone64_arm64 model:sdk_gphone64_arm64
```

The only other update our existing script needs is to include the model name when the list of devices is displayed. 
```shell
find_matches=$(echo "$valid_devices" | awk 'match($0, /model:/) {print NR " - " $1 " (" substr($0, RSTART+6) ")"}')
```
At the heart of it, what we need to do is extract pieces of information from each line; so `awk` should be good enough for this. When `awk` is invoked, it:
- reads the input line by line
- stores each line in a variable `$0`
- splits each line into words
- stores each word in variable from `$1..$n`

There's a lot of things happening in that `awk` command, so let's step through what it will do for each line in `valid_devices`:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="4"><code>match($0, /model:/)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>match</code></td>
<td>built-in function that finds the first match of the provided regular expression</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>$0</code></td>
<td>field variable containing the whole line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>/model:/</code></td>
<td>the regular expression to match ("model:"), <code>awk</code> syntax needs it to be inside slashes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4"><code>print NR " - " $1 " (" substr($0, RSTART+6) ")"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>print</code></td>
<td>prints the succeeding items concatenated with the designated separator (default is a space)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>NR</code></td>
<td>the record number (i.e. line number being read)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>" - "</code></td>
<td>print a literal space, a dash, and a space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>$1</code></td>
<td>field variable containing the first word</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>" ("</code></td>
<td>print a literal space and an open brace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><code>substr($0, RSTART+6)</code></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>substr</code></td>
<td>built-in function to get a substring from <code>$0</code>, starting at index <code>RSTART+6</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>$0</code></td>
<td>field variable that contains the whole line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>RSTART</code></td>
<td>the index of the last call to <code>match</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>+6</code></td>
<td>move the pointer six places (basically skip "model:")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>")"</code></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;print a literal closing brace</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I found [awk.js.org](https://awk.js.org/help.html) and [jdoodle.com](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-awk-online) really helpful when playing around with `awk`. I found the explanations in `awk.js.org` particularly useful. 

Running the `deeplink` alias again now shows the model name inside braces:
```shell
‚ûú  ~ deeplink https://zarah.dev
Multiple devices found:
1 - R5CR7039LBJ (SM_G998B)
2 - 39030FDJH01460 (Pixel_8)
3 - emulator-5554 (sdk_gphone64_arm64)
Select device: 
```

Much better! üëå I just need to make sure I don't have to use more Samsungs cause I can _never_ keep track of which Galaxy/Note/etc is which `SM_`. üòÖ

As always, the gist is in [Github](https://gist.github.com/zmdominguez/9a889f1c367e1a21203ce8527c81e612).
