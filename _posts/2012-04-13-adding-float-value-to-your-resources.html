Earlier today, I was trying to figure out how to add a float value to constants file. What I used to do was add a string value in my <code>strings.xml</code>, retrieve the string value, and convert it to float. <pre class="brush:java">float floatFromFile = Float.valueOf(getResources().getString(R.string.my_float));</pre> I was trying out something new but it wasn't working, so I decided to look for a more accepted solution. Google led me to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3282390/add-floating-point-value-to-android-resources-values">StackOverflow question</a>. I was on the right track after all! I think the accepted answer is incomplete, or not clear enough for my purposes.  I ended up having this entry in my <code>dimensions.xml</code> file: <pre class="brush:xml">&lt;item name=&quot;face_feature_marker_size&quot; type=&quot;vals&quot; format=&quot;float&quot;&gt;2.0&lt;/item&gt;</pre> And then in my code, I retrieve the value as: <pre class="brush:java">TypedValue tempVal = new TypedValue();<br />getResources().getValue(R.vals.face_feature_marker_size, tempVal, true);<br />float markerSize = testVal.getFloat();</pre> I ended up having more lines of code with no idea if this is more optimized. Let me know what you think!
