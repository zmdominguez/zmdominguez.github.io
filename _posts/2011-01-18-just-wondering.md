You know those postscripts that Google engineers have on their posts in forums? I wonder if they have a sort of "standards body" that came up with it. They all sound like this:

> Note: please don't send private questions to me, as I don't have time to provide private support.  All such questions should be posted on public forums, where I and others can see and answer them 

I wonder why I wonder about these things.
