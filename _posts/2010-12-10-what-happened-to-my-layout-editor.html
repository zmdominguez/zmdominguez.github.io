There you are, happily creating your layout files in the Eclipse plug-in's layout editor. Dragging and dropping is a breeze.  But then one day, you open a layout XML file and boom! No UI!  All you see is the XML tree with all the nodes and attributes.  What happened?<br /><br />This happened to me and I was in a panic for a few seconds.  Why do things like these have to happen to me?  I tried opening a layout file from another project in the same workspace, and it has the UI! What happened?<br /><br />It probably has something to do with the interpreter you used to open the XML file, a voice in my head said. So I tried right-clicking on the XML file, and lo and behold, I found it. I may have accidentally clicked on some file in one of my mad-clicking moments and changed the setting.<br /><br />So anyway, to bring back the Layout UI Editor, right click on an XML file > Choose Open With > Android Layout Editor.<br /><br />I would say that everything is handy dandy, but apparently, the engineers at Google decided that we developers need a little less help and removed the <span style="font-weight:bold;">very useful</span> up and down arrow keys in the Outline View when editing XML layouts. Why do they hurt us like this?<br /><br />I WANT MY UP/DOWN KEYS BACK!
