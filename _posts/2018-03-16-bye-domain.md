Today is my last day at Domain. After three years, seven months, and three days, it is time to move out.

I will forever be grateful to Domain for bringing me to Australia. Everyone has welcomed this tiny Filipina with open arms, helping me adjust to a new country (there were a _lot_ of trips to the pub).

Our scrappy little app has grown so much over the years. I could never be prouder of what we have accomplished over the years.

We were able to share [our Developer Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFlX9rW7Epc) to the world, got a [bunch of awards](https://ausdroid.net/2015/10/16/australian-property-site-domain-cleans-up-at-the-design-100-australian-app-awards/), get recognised as [one of the best apps of the year](http://tech.domain.com.au/2017/02/android-teams-2016-in-review/), and [launched](https://ausdroid.net/2015/04/29/australian-property-site-domain-is-the-first-australian-company-to-have-a-google-now-card/) [a lot](https://ausdroid.net/2016/06/14/domain-launches-new-check-tool-let-easily-register-interest/) [of](https://ausdroid.net/2017/10/22/find-next-home-domain-google-assistant-app/) [features](https://ausdroid.net/2015/12/18/domain-adds-voice-commands-to-android-apps-to-get-you-faster-results/).

<small>I spy with my little eye the Domain logo at Google I/O!</small></p>

Since joining Domain, I have become [a Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/zarah-dominguez), vastly expanded my [speaking portfolio](http://zdominguez.com/about/), learnt [how to bake](https://www.instagram.com/p/BX-kNH5HHEP/), and most importantly, met some pretty great people. ðŸ˜Š

What a rollercoaster it has been!
