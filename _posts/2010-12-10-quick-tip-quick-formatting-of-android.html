One of the most useful tools in Android's Eclipse plug-in is the Layout Editor. It is easy to experiment with layouts using the drag-and-drop enabled editor without having to worry about the correct syntax or if you are using the correct attribute name.<br /><br />After creating your layout this way, however, you can end up with a messy XML file. I say "messy" in the sense that elements can run on in one veeeeeeeeeeeery long line, and if you are about to edit the XML file manually, this can be a nightmare.<br /><br />I used to format the XML file by hand, putting in line breaks and correcting indentation.  But one edit using the graphical layout editor and it's messed up again.  And then I had a light bulb moment. Eclipse allows auto-formatting of code, but what about XML files? AHA!<br /><br />It turns out that auto-formatting works for XML files too! Simply select all the contents of the XML file (CTRL-A) and then press the ultra magical shortcut CTRL-I and your XML file is clean and orderly as can be! YAY!
