With clients demanding left and right that my app should look like an iPhone app, I tend to be unappreciative of the way Android natively handles UI interactions and such.  Notice how the screen automagically scrolls up when you click on an <tt>EditText</tt>? It turns out that in iPhone development, the developer does this manually (indicate how much the view should scroll when the on-screen keyboard appears, then scroll it back down afterwards). HA!<br /><br />But even magic fails sometimes. Has this ever happened to you?<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JftkETrkB2c/TZlrHJOji5I/AAAAAAAAA4I/cX4jSBJRiGY/s1600/edittext_hidden.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 134px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JftkETrkB2c/TZlrHJOji5I/AAAAAAAAA4I/cX4jSBJRiGY/s200/edittext_hidden.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591618182837406610" /></a><br />The bottommost <tt>EditText</tt> is cut off. And we don't want that!<br /><br />So what do we do? Do we programmatically scroll the view up? I don't want to do that! It turns out that we can just wrap the whole view in a <tt>ScrollView</tt> and it will scroll up properly!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J2UCMLF_E3k/TZlrk_lKBdI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/c7G321XalBo/s1600/edittext_shown.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 134px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J2UCMLF_E3k/TZlrk_lKBdI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/c7G321XalBo/s200/edittext_shown.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591618695643923922" /></a><br /><br />The only downside to this is that you might want to hide the scrollbar when the view moves up to accommodate the on-screen keyboard. And to do that, I was trying to set the android:scrollbars="none" attribute but for one reason or another the scrollbar is still being drawn. To make the scrollbar disappear, we can do it from code as such:<pre class="brush:java">((ScrollView)findViewById(R.id.my_scrollview))<br />     .setVerticalScrollBarEnabled(false);</pre>And we're done!
