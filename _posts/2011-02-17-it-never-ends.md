Been ultra super busy the past few weeks. Also learning a lot of new things. And renewing my battle with orientation change, AsyncTasks and dialog boxes.

So, I have been thinking of what to document here next. Here are my choices:
- Loading HTML pages stored in the SD card in a WebView
- Managing your SharedPreferences
- Using a ViewStub

I had a long list in my mind yesterday, but I managed to not write it down. \*facepalm*
