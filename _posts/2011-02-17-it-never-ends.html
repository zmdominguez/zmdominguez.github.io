Been ultra super busy the past few weeks. Also learning a lot of new things. And renewing my battle with orientation change, AsyncTasks and dialog boxes.<br /><br />So, I have been thinking of what to document here next. Here are my choices:<br />- Loading HTML pages stored in the SD card in a WebView<br />- Managing your SharedPreferences<br />- Using a ViewStub<br /><br />I had a long list in my mind yesterday, but I managed to not write it down. *facepalm*
