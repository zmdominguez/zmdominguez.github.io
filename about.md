# Speaking

I give talks about development in general and about Android in particular.

  {% include documents-collection.html collection="speaking" sort_by=page.sort_by sort_order=page.sort_order %}
</div>


# Features

Some videos and/or featurettes that include me.

</div>


# Interviews

From time to time, I have a chat with other people and it ends up on the internet.
